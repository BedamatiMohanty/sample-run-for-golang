The Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) is a RESTful Protocol and
API for all kinds of Management tasks. OCCI was originally initiated
to create a remote management API for IaaS model based Services,
allowing for the development of interoperable tools for common tasks
including deployment, autonomic scaling and monitoring. It now can be
used to serve other models as well. To be modular and extensible the
current specification itself is currently split into three
complimentary documents:

\begin{itemize}
\item Core - this defines the OCCI model
\item RESTful HTTP Rendering - this defines how to manipulate the core model
  using the OCCI RESTful API. The document defines how the OCCI model
  can be communicated and thus serialized using HTTP.
\item Infrastructure - this defines the infrastructure domain resource
  types, the required attributes for each and the actions that can be
  taken on each.
\end{itemize}
