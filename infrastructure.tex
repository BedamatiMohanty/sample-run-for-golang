\section{Introduction}
\input{include/introduction}

OCCI makes an ideal interoperable boundary interface between the web and the internal resource management system of infrastructure providers.

\section{Notational Conventions}
\input{include/notational}

UML activity diagrams do not specify how OCCI should be rendered but what possible request and outcomes can be.

\section{Infrastructure}

The main infrastructure domain Resource types within OCCI, including their specification definitions, are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute: Information processing resources.
\item Network: Interconnection resources.
\item Storage: Information recording resources.
\end{itemize}
These infrastructure Resource types inherit the core Resource base type and all its attributes. OCCI implementors MUST implement these types. The HTTP Rendering document defines how to interact with these resource types using RESTful communication.

As REQUIRED by the OCCI Core specification every resource type instantiated that is a subclass of Resource MUST be assigned a Category that identifies the instantiated resource type. Each such Category MUST be related to the Resource base type Category. These Categories, the core categories, MUST always remain immutable to any client.

The following table describe the Category defined for each of the infrastructure Resource subtypes:

\begin{tabular}{llllll}
Term&Scheme&Title&Attribute&Actions&Related-Category\\
\hline
compute & http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\# & Compute Resource & See Below & See Below & http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource\\
storage & http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\# & Storage Resource & See Below & See Below & http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource\\
network & http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\# & Network Resource & See Below & See Below & http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource\\
\end{tabular}

The following sections on Compute, Storage and Network detail the Attributes and Actions defined for each resource type.

\subsection{Compute}
The Compute Resource type is assigned the http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#compute Category. A Compute Resource instance MUST at least expose this Category.

\subsection{Linking Infrastructure Resources}
In order to create entities like virtual data centres or virtual clusters, it is necessary to allow the linking of the various infrastructure Resource types. This can be accomplished extending the core specification Link entity as the Link entity does not include enough information about specific types of infrastructure links.

\subsubsection{Linking to Network Resources}
NetworkInterface represents an L2 client device (e.g. network adapter). It can be extended using the mix-in mechanism or sub-classed to support L3/L4 capabilities such as TCP/IP etc. 

The Networkinterface Link type is assigned the http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#networkinterface Category. A Networkinterface Link instance MUST use and expose this Category.

\paragraph{Attributes}
The attributes that MUST be exposed by an instance of the NetworkInterface Link type are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Attribute&Type&Multiplicity&Mutability&Description\\
\hline
occi.networklink.interface & String & 1 & Immutable & Identifier that relates the link to the link's device interface\\
occi.networklink.mac & String & 1 & Mutable & MAC address associated with the link's device interface\\
occi.networklink.state & String Enumeration\{ active, inactive \}& 1 & Immutable & Current status of the instance.\\
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{States}
Depicted below are the states that a NetworkInterface instance can hold.

	\label{fig:networklink_state}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{IPNetworkInterface Mixin}
In order to support L3/L4 capabilities (e.g. IP, TCP etc) with the NetworkInterface Link type an OCCI mixin is herewith defined.

The IPNetworkInterface mixin is assigned the http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure/networkinterface\#ipnetworkinterface Category. An IPNetworking mixin MUST use and expose this Category.

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Attribute&Type&Multiplicity&Mutability&Description\\
\hline
occi.networkinterface.ip & IPv4 or IPv6 Address & 1 & Mutable & Internet Protocol(IP) network address (e.g. 192.168.0.1/24, fc00::/7) of the link\\
occi.networkinterface.gateway & IPv4 or IPv6 Address & 0\ldots1 & Mutable & Internet Protocol(IP) network address (e.g. 192.168.0.1/24, fc00::/7)\\
occi.networkinterface.allocation & String Enumeration, \{dynamic, static\} & 1 & Mutable & Address mechanism: dynamic use the dynamic host configuration protocol, static uses user supplied static network configurations.\\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Linking to Storage Resources}
StorageLink Link type represents a link from a Resource to a target Storage Resource.

The StorageLink Link type is assigned the  http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#storagelink Category. A StorageLink Link instance MUST use and expose this Category.

\paragraph{Attributes}
The attributes that MUST be exposed by an instance of the StorageLink Link type are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Attribute&Type&Multiplicity&Mutability&Description\\
\hline
occi.storagelink.deviceid & String & 1 & Mutable & Device identifier as defined by the IEEE ??? standard.\\
%occi.storagelink.osdevice & String & 0\ldots1 & Mutable & Device identifier as presented to the guest OS.\\
occi.storagelink.mountpoint & String & 0\ldots1 & Mutable & Point to where the storage is mounted in the guest OS.\\
occi.storagelink.state & String Enumeration\{ active, inactive \}& 1 & Immutable & Current status of the instance.\\
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{States}
Depicted below are the states that a StorageLink instance can hold.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figs/infra-link-state.png}
	\caption{State diagram for StorageLink}
	\label{fig:storagelink_state}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Infrastructure Templates}
There are 2 supported infrastructural template types in OCCI.

\subsubsection{OS Template}
OCCI implementers SHOULD support this, otherwise what they provision will be merely Resources without any execution environment (e.g. operating system). Of the two supported template types, this is the most basic and necessary template category that a provider SHOULD offer. The construction of it consists of a provider specific 'scheme' and a descriptive 'title' detailing the OS. The 'term' value of the template category is a provider specific identifier that corresponds to a particular virtual machine image configuration. A provider-defined OS Template Category MUST be related to the OCCI OS Template Category in order to give absolute type information. The OS Template Category is defined by the http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#os\_tpl Category.

A typical example of such a category is shown below using the HTTP rendering. 

\begin{verbatim}
POST /compute
Category: compute; scheme='http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure#'; title='Compute Instance', 
    ubuntu-9.10; scheme='http://provider.com/templates/os#'; title='Ubuntu 9.10'
Attribute: occi.compute.memory=0.5, occi.compute.cores=2
\end{verbatim}
In the example a provider has defined an OS template which offers the ability to run Ubuntu Linux upon a client's provisioned compute resource.

How a provider manages their set of OS templates will be determined by themselves and so provider-specific.

\subsubsection{Resource Template}
The Resource Template Category builds upon the concept of OS Templates. A Resource Template is a provider-defined Category that refers to a preset Resource configuration. The provider will associate a pre-determined set of Resource attributes with a particular term identifier. A provider-defined Resource Template Category MUST be related to the OCCI Resource Template Category. The Resource Template Category is defined by the http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#resource\_tpl Category.

A typical example of such a Category's use is shown below using the HTTP rendering. 

\begin{verbatim}
POST /compute
Category: compute; scheme='http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure#'; title='Compute Instance', 
    small; scheme="http://provider.com/templates/compute#"; title="Small Instance", 
    ubuntu-9.10; scheme=""; title=""
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the provider offers Compute Resources based on different sizes (small, medium, large). Each 'size' of Compute Resource corresponds to a predetermined set of OCCI attributes. In the example below a "small" Compute Resource is provisioned. Specifying "small" corresponds to a Compute Resource Attribute set of:

\begin{verbatim}
Attribute: occi.compute.cores='2', occi.compute.speed='2.4', 
    occi.compute.memory='1.0', occi.compute.arch='x86'
\end{verbatim}

How a provider manages from the administrative context their set of Resource Templates will be determined by themselves and so provider-specific.
