\underline{Abstract}

This document, part of a document series, produced by the OCCI working group within the Open Grid Forum (OGF), provides a high-level definition of a Protocol and API. The document is based upon previously gathered requirements and focuses on the scope of important capabilities required to support modern service offerings.

\section{Introduction}

The Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) is a RESTful Protocol (and API) for all kinds of Management tasks. Originally initiated to create a remote management API for IaaS model based Services, allowing for the development of interoperable tools for common tasks including deployment, autonomic scaling and monitoring, it now can be used to severe other models as well. To be modular and extensible the current specification itself is currently split into three complimentary documents:

\begin{itemize}
\item Core ‚Äì this defines the OCCI model
\item HTTP Rendering - this defines how to manipulate the core model using the OCCI RESTful API. The document defines how the OCCI model can be communicated and thus serialized using HTTP.
\item Infrastructure ‚Äì this defines the infrastructure domain resource types, the required attributes for each and the actions that can be taken on each.
\end{itemize}

\section{Notational Conventions}

All these parts and the information within are mandatory for implementors (unless otherwise specified). The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 

UML activity diagrams do not specify how OCCI should be rendered but what possible request and outcomes can be.
