\section{OCCI model}
OCCI is a boundary protocol and API
that acts as a service front-end to a provider's internal management
framework. Figure~\ref{fig:placement} shows OCCI's place in a
provider's architecture.

\begin{figure}[!hp]

	\caption{OCCI's place in a provider's architecture}
	\label{fig:placement}
\end{figure}

The heart of the OCCI model is the \hl{Resource} type. Any resource exposed
through OCCI is a \hl{Resource} or sub-type thereof.
A resource can be e.g. a virtual machine, a job in a job submission system, a
user, etc.
%
The \hl{Resource} type contains a number of common attributes that
domain-specific \hl{Resource} types inherit. The \hl{Resource} type is
complemented by the \hl{Link} type which associates one \hl{Resource} instance
with another.
%
The \hl{Link} type also contains a number of common attributes that
domain-specific \hl{Link} types inherit.

\hl{Kind} is an abstract type which both \hl{Resource} and \hl{Link} inherit.
Each sub-type of \hl{Kind} is identified by a unique \hl{Type} instance.
%
The \hl{Type} type comprise the classification system built into the OCCI
model. \hl{Type} is a specialisation of \hl{Category} and introduce additional
capabilities in terms of \hl{Action} types.

\end{figure}

The UML class diagram shown in figure~\ref{fig:occi_model} gives an overview of
the OCCI model.  For compliance with OCCI Core, all of the types defined in
the OCCI model MUST be implemented.
The following sections of the specification define the details of the OCCI
model.

\subsection{Classification and Identification}

The OCCI model provides a builtin classification system allowing for safe
extension towards domin-specific usage. This system is like a ``type system''
but with the possiblity of being easily exposed over a text based protocol.
%
The classification system can be summarised with the following key features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each OCCI base type and extension thereof is assigned a unique
 identifier, a structural \hl{Type}, which allow for dynamic discovery of available
 types.
\item The relationship of structural \hl{Type}s is part of the system and thus
 the inheritance model is also discoverable.
\item The classification system allow non-structural \hl{Type}s to be assigned
 to resource instances adding new capabilities using a mix-in model.
\item Tagging of resource instances is supported through mix-in of
 non-structural \hl{Type}s which have no additional capabilities defined.
\item A collection of associated resources is implicitly defined for each
 structural and non-structural \hl{Type}. I.e.~all resource instances
 associated with a particular \hl{Type} instance form a collection.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Type}
\label{sec:type}
The \hl{Type} type comprise the classification system provided by OCCI
model. It MUST be implemented. A \hl{Type} instance can be either structural or
non-structural.

\mytablefloat{\label{tbl:type}Attributes defined for the \hl{Type} type}{
\begin{tabular}{llllp{2.7in}}
\toprule
Attribute & Type & Multiplicity & Client Mutability & Description \\
\colrule
actions & \hl{Action} & 0..* & Immutable & Set of \hl{Action}s defined by the \hl{Type} instance. \\

kind & \hl{Kind} & 0..1 & Immutable & \hl{Kind} type uniquely identified by the \hl{Type} instance. \\
\botrule
\end{tabular}
}
The \hl{Type} type inherit the \hl{Category} type and all inherited
attributes MUST be implemented. Table~\ref{tbl:type} defines the
additional attributes the \hl{Type} type MUST implement to be compliant.

\paragraph*{Structural Type}
A structural \hl{Type} is an instance of \hl{Type} assigned as the unique
identifier of a \hl{Kind} sub-type. The following rules apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item A structural \hl{Type} define the capabilities of a \hl{Kind} sub-type in terms of attributes and \hl{Action}s.
\item A unique structural \hl{Type} MUST be assigned to each and every sub-type
 of \hl{Kind}.
\item A structural \hl{Type} MUST be related, either directly or indirectly, to
 the structural \hl{Type} of \hl{Kind},
 i.e.~\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#kind}.
 %
 See section~\ref{sec:type_relationship} for the definition of \hl{Type}
 relationship.
\item If type {\bf B} inherit type {\bf A}, where {\bf A} is a sub-type of
 \hl{Kind}, the structural \hl{Type} of {\bf B} MUST be directly related to the
 structural \hl{Type} of {\bf A}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Non-structural Type} A non-structural \hl{Type} is an instance of
\hl{Type} {\em not} assigned as the unique identifier of any \hl{Kind} sub-type.
The following rules apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item A non-structural \hl{Type} define additional capabilities for each
 \hl{Kind} sub-type instance it is associated with. A non-structural \hl{Type}
 add capabilities using a mix-in like model.
\item A non-structural \hl{Type} MUST only be associated with \hl{Kind}
 sub-type {\em instances}, either at creation-time or run-time.
\item A non-structural \hl{Type} MUST NOT be related, neither directly nor
 indirectly, to the structural \hl{Type} of \hl{Kind},
 i.e.~\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#kind}.
 %
 See section~\ref{sec:type_relationship} for the definition of \hl{Type}
 relationship.
\item A non-structural \hl{Type} defining no additional capabilities in terms
 of attributes or \hl{Action}s is considered to be a tag.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Category}
\label{sec:category}
The \hl{Category} type comprise basis of identification used by the OCCI
classification system. It MUST be implemented. Instances of the \hl{Category}
type are only used to identify \hl{Action} types. All other uses of
\hl{Category} properties are managed through its sub-type \hl{Type}.
%
Table~\ref{tbl:type} defines the attributes the \hl{Category} type MUST
implement to be compliant.

\mytablefloat{\label{tbl:category}Attributes defined for the \hl{Category} type}{
\begin{tabular}{llllp{2.7in}}
\toprule
Attribute & Type & Multiplicity & Client Mutability & Description \\
\colrule
term & String & 1 & Immutable & Unique identifier of the \hl{Category} instance within the categorization scheme. \\
scheme & URI & 1 & Immutable & The categorization scheme. \\
title & String & 0..1 & Immutable & Denotes the display name of an instance. \\
attributes & String & 0..* & Immutable & Comprise the resource attribute names defined by the \hl{Category} instance. \\
\botrule
\end{tabular}
}

A \hl{Category} is uniquely identified by concatenating the categorization
scheme with the category term,
e.g.~\textit{http://example.com/category/scheme\#term}.
This is done to enable discovery of \hl{Category} definitions in text based
renderings such as HTTP. All renderings MUST make use and understand
concatenated unique identifiers of \hl{Category} types.
%
Sub-types of \hl{Category} such as \hl{Type} inherit this property.

The categorization schemes defined in the OCCI specification all use the
\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/} base URL. This base URL is reserved for
OCCI an MUST NOT be used by domain-specific extensions.

Attribute names defined by \hl{Category} instances%
\footnote{Also applies to \hl{Type} instances.}
use the \texttt{occi.}~prefix.  This prefix is reserved for OCCI and MUST NOT
be used by domain-specific extensions.

\subsubsection{Type relationship}
\label{sec:type_relationship}
As previously defined a structural \hl{Type} MUST be related, either
either directly or indirectly, to the structural \hl{Type} of \hl{Kind},
i.e.~\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#kind}.
%
The OCCI base types \hl{Resource} and \hl{Link} extending \hl{Kind}, and any
futher sub-typing, implies a hierarchy of related structural \hl{Type}
instances. This \hl{Type} relationship thus mirror the type inheritance
structure of the OCCI model and any extension thereof.

In an example where a domain-specific ``Custom Compute Resource'' is a sub-type
the OCCI infrastructure type Compute, which in turn is a sub-type of the
\hl{Resource} type, four related structural \hl{Type}s would be involved.
%
Table~\ref{tbl:relationship} illustrates the exemplified hierarchy of \hl{Type}
instances relating the domain-specific structural \hl{Type} to the structural
\hl{Type} of \hl{Kind}.

\mytablefloat{\label{tbl:relationship}Exempel of the \hl{Type} relationship involved
for a domain-specific extension of the OCCI infrastructure type \hl{Compute}.}{
\begin{tabular}{p{7cm}p{7cm}}
\toprule
Structural Type & Related Structural Type \\
\colrule
\textit{http://example.com/occi/custom\#compute} & \textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#compute} \\
\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#compute} & \textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource} \\
\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource} & \textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#kind} \\
\botrule
\end{tabular}
}

\subsubsection{Type assignment}
\label{sec:type_assignment}
A structural \hl{Type} MUST be statically assigned to each sub-type of
\hl{Kind} defined by an implementation. A \hl{Kind} sub-type instance MUST be
automatically associated with its structural \hl{Type} at creation-time.  The
structural \hl{Type} associated with an instance MUST remain associated with the
instance during its lifetime.

A non-structural \hl{Type}, also known as a mix-in, MAY be associated with a
\hl{Kind} sub-type instance, either at creation-time or run-time. An OCCI
implementation MAY restrict which instances can be associated with a particular
non-structural \hl{Type}.

\subsubsection{Collections}
\label{sec:collection}
One or more \hl{Kind} sub-type instances associated with the same \hl{Type},
may it be structural or non-structural, automatically form a collection.
Each \hl{Type} instance in the system identifies a collection consisting of all
different \hl{Kind} sub-type instances associated with the \hl{Type}.

A \hl{Kind} sub-type instance is always a member of the \hl{Kind}'s structural
\hl{Type} collection since a \hl{Kind} sub-type instance MUST be associated
with the structural \hl{Type} of the \hl{Kind} sub-type.
Since a non-structural \hl{Type} can be assigned to any \hl{Kind} sub-type
instance a collection can contain instances of different \hl{Kind} sub-types.

For example an instance of the \hl{Resource} type will always be associated
with the \textit{http://scheme.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource} \hl{Type} and thus
part of the \hl{Resource} \hl{Type} collection.

\subsubsection{Discovery}
\label{sec:discovery}
An OCCI client MUST be able to discover all instances of \hl{Type} and
\hl{Category} a particular service provider's OCCI implementation support. By
examining these instances a client MUST be able to, at a minimum, deduce the
following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \hl{Kind} sub-types available from a the service provider, including domain-specific extensions.
\item The attributes associated with each \hl{Kind} sub-type.
\item The invocable operations, i.e. \hl{Action}s, defined for each \hl{Kind} sub-type.
\item Additional mix-ins or tags, i.e. non-structural \hl{Type}s, applicable to
 \hl{Kind} sub-type instances.
\end{itemize}
The above requirements comprise the OCCI discovery mechanism. It MUST be
implemented.
%
The details of exactly how the \hl{Category} and \hl{Type} instances are
exposed to an OCCI client is specific to the particular rendering used.
\marginpar{References?}
The relevant details can be found in the OCCI rendering documents.

\begin{comment}
The central component of the classification system is the \hl{Type} type which
is a specialisation of the \hl{Category} type. The following sections describe
the OCCI classification system in detail.

Each OCCI base type, see section~\ref{sec:base_types}, is assigned a
unique identifier.  This identifier is an instance of \hl{Type} and comprise
the structural \hl{Type} of the associated base type%
\footnote{The \hl{Action} type is an exception and is instead uniquely
identified by a \hl{Category} instance. An \hl{Action} is a capability of \hl{Type}
and can therefore not be identified by \hl{Type}.}.

\begin{comment}
%%% CLIENT Interaction, do we need to specify this explicitly?!
\subsubsection{Creating Instances}
A client MUST supply the concrete Kind type as a Category. All OCCI
implementations MUST understand these requests containing concrete
Kind types, i.e. Resource, Link, Action or a subtype thereof.

When a client attempts to add a non-structural
\hl{Type} at a stage not supported by a particular provider's OCCI
implementation, the provider MUST notify the client it has issued a bad
request.
\end{comment}

\subsection{The OCCI base types}
\label{sec:base_types}
The following sections describe the OCCI base types defined by the OCCI model.
The base types are \hl{Kind}, \hl{Resource}, \hl{Link} and \hl{Action}. All
base types MUST be implemented.

\subsubsection{Kind}
\label{sec:kind}
The \hl{Kind} type is the abstract base type for \hl{Resource} and \hl{Link}
and any domain-specific sub-type thereof. It MUST be implemented.
%
Table~\ref{tbl:kind} defines the attributes the \hl{Kind} type MUST implement to
be compliant.

\mytablefloat{\label{tbl:kind}Attributes defined for the \hl{Kind} type.}{
\begin{tabular}{llllp{7cm}}
\toprule
Attribute & Type & Multiplicity & Client Mutability & Description \\
\colrule
id & URI & 1 & Immutable & A unique identifier (within the service provider's name-space) of the \hl{Kind} sub-type instance. \\
title & String & 0..1 & Mutable & The display name of the instance. \\
structural type & \hl{Type} & 1 & Immutable & The structural \hl{Type} of the instance. \\
non-structural types & \hl{Type} & 0..* & Mutable & The non-structural \hl{Type}s associated to this instance. Consumers can expect the attributes and \hl{Action}s of the associated non-structural \hl{Type}s to be exposed by the instance. \\ 
\botrule
\end{tabular}
}

\hl{Kind} enforces for all sub-types a required \texttt{id} attribute and an
optional \texttt{title} attribute.
%
Every sub-type of \hl{Kind} MUST be assigned a structural \hl{Type}, see
sectian~\ref{sec:type}. \hl{Kind} itself is assigned the structural \hl{Type}
\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#kind}.
%
A \hl{Kind} sub-type instance MAY be associated with one or more non-structural
\hl{Type}s.

A \hl{Kind} sub-type instance MUST expose its structural \hl{Type} and any
associated non-structural \hl{Type}s together with their associated attributes
and \hl{Action}s.

\subsubsection{Resource}
\label{sec:resource}
The \hl{Resource} type inherit \hl{Kind} and describes a concrete resource that
can be inspected and manipulated. It represents a general object in the OCCI
model and MUST be implemented.
%
The \hl{Resource} type MUST implement all attributes inherited from the
\hl{Kind} type together with the attributes defined in table~\ref{tbl:resource}
in order to be compliant.
%
The Resource type is assigned the structural \hl{Type}
\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource}.

\mytablefloat{\label{tbl:resource}Attributes defined for the \hl{Resource} type.}{
\begin{tabular}{llllp{8cm}}
\toprule
Attribute & Type & Multiplicity & Client Mutability & Description \\
\colrule
summary & String & 0..1 & Mutable & A summarizing description of the \hl{Resource} instance.\\
links & \hl{Link} & 0..* & Mutable & A set of \hl{Link} compositions. Being a composite relation the removal of a \hl{Link} from the set MUST also remove the \hl{Link} instance.\\
\botrule
\end{tabular}
}

\hl{Resource} enforces the inheritance of a set of common attributes into
sub-types. Moreover, it introduces relationships to other \hl{Resource}
instances through instances of the \hl{Link} type.
%
The \hl{Resource} type is the entry point for domain-specific extensions of the
OCCI model, see section~\ref{sec:extension}.

\subsubsection{Link}
\label{sec:link}
An instance of the \hl{Link} type defines a base association between two
\hl{Resource} instances. It MUST be implemented. A \hl{Link} instance indicates
that one \hl{Resource} instance is connected to another.
%
The \hl{Link} type MUST implement all attributes inherited from the
\hl{Kind} type together with the attributes defined in table~\ref{tbl:link}
in order to be compliant.
%
The Link type is assigned the structural \hl{Type}
\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#link}.

\mytablefloat{\label{tbl:link}Attributes defined for the \hl{Link} type.}{
\begin{tabular}{llllp{7.5cm}}
\toprule
Attribute & Type & Multiplicity & Client Mutability & Description \\
\colrule
source & \hl{Resource} & 1 & Mutable & The \hl{Resource} instances the \hl{Link} instance originates from.\\
target & \hl{Resource} & 1 & Mutable & The \hl{Resource} instances the \hl{Link} instance points to.\\
\botrule
\end{tabular}
}

An instance of the \hl{Link} type MUST NOT refer to an external resource.  A
provider MAY however create a sub-type of \hl{Link} with different semantics,
e.g. have a target attribute containing an URI and thus the ability of linking
with external resources.
%
The \hl{Link} type can be sub-typed for domain-specific extensions of the
OCCI model, see section~\ref{sec:extension}.

\subsubsection{Action}
The \hl{Action} type defines an invocable operation applicable to a \hl{Kind}
sub-type instance or a collection thereof. It MUST be implemented. In general,
\hl{Action}s modify state by e.g. performing a complex operation such as
rebooting a virtual machine.
%
Table~\ref{tbl:action} defines the attributes the \hl{Action} type MUST
implement to be compliant.

\mytablefloat{\label{tbl:action}Attributes defined for the \hl{Action} type.}{
\begin{tabular}{llllp{7.5cm}}
\toprule
Attribute & Type & Multiplicity & Client Mutability & Description \\
\colrule
category & \hl{Category} & 1 & Immutable & The identifying \hl{Category} of the \hl{Action}. \\
parameters & String & 0..* & Immutable & Enumeration of valid parameters for the \hl{Action}. \\
\botrule
\end{tabular}
}

An \hl{Action} is always bound to a \hl{Type} instance through a composite
association. An \hl{Action} is considered a capability of the \hl{Type}.  An
\hl{Action} MAY be invoked on any \hl{Kind} sub-type instance associated with
the \hl{Type} instance defining the \hl{Action}. An OCCI implementation MAY
refuse an \hl{Action} from being invoked if currently not applicable.

An \hl{Action} MAY be invoked on a collection of \hl{Kind} sub-type instances.
The \hl{Action} is only considered valid if all instances of the collection are
associated with the \hl{Type} defining the \hl{Action}.

The Action type is assigned the \hl{Category} identifier
\textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#action}.
%
The \hl{Action} type can be sub-typed for domain-specific extensions of the
OCCI model, see section~\ref{sec:extension}.

\subsection{Mutability}
\marginpar{Does 'client access' need to be discussed here?}
Attributes of a OCCI base type instance, a resource instance, are
either client mutable or client immutable. If an attribute is noted to
be mutable this MUST be interpreted that a client can create a
resource instance that is parametrized by the attribute. Likewise, if
an attribute is mutable, a client can update that resource instance's
mutable attribute value and the server side MUST support this. If an
attribute is marked as immutable, it indicates that the server side
implementation MUST manage these exclusively. Immutable attributes
MUST NOT be modifiable by clients under any circumstance.

\subsection{Type System}
\label{sec:type_system}
The Category type is the classification mechanism used by OCCI. This
tells service providers what type of concrete OCCI Kind should be
created. Each domain-specific section of the OCCI specification
(e.g. infrastructure) defines its own concrete Resource, Action and
optionally Link specializations. It should be noted that depending on
a client's credentials, access to creating certain OCCI Kind sub-type instances
MAY be restricted.

The type system is a flexible and extensible one allowing for the
addition of "mix-in" Category types. Mix-in Category types are ones
that add additional behavior to OCCI Kinds and are Category types not
defined by the OCCI specifications. The mix-in Category types can be
added to an OCCI Kind both at Kind creation-time and run-time. The
Kinds to which a particular mix-in Category type can be applied, is
defined by the provider implementation. At which time, creation- or
run-time, these mix-in types can be applied is also defined by the
provider implementation. Discovery of mix-in types can be achieved by
querying the OCCI Query interface. Mix-in Category types are those
that are NOT related to an OCCI base type Category and MUST be
implemented as such. When a client attempts to add a mix-in at a stage
not supported by the provider, the provider MUST notify the client
that it has issued a bad request.

\subsubsection{Creating Instances}
A client MUST supply the concrete Kind type as a Category. All OCCI
implementations MUST understand these requests containing concrete
Kind types, i.e. Resource, Link, Action or a subtype thereof.

\subsection{Collections}
\label{sec:collection}
One or more Kind sub-type instances assigned to the same Category
automatically form a collection. Each Category in the system
identifies a collection consisting of all different Kind sub-type instances
associated with the Category.

A Kind sub-type instance is always a member of the Kind's identifying
Category collection since a Kind sub-type instance MUST be assigned the
identifying Category of the Kind sub-type.
Since a tag Category can be assigned to any Kind sub-type
instance a collection can contain instances of different Kind
sub-types.

For example an instance of the Resource type will be assigned the
\textit{http://scheme.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource} Category and thus
part of the Resource Category collection.

\subsection{Extensibility}
\label{sec:extension}
The OCCI Core model has a flexible yet fairly simple extension
mechanism through the use of sub-typing and Category types.

\subsubsection{Sub-types and Category Types}
The OCCI Core model has a flexible yet fairly simple extension
mechanism through the use of sub-typing and Category types.  A
provider MAY extend the OCCI core model by creating a subtype of
either an OCCI Core base type or a provider defined subtype.

A provider MUST assign a new unique Category to each new subtype
defined. The new Category MUST be, either directly or indirectly,
related to one of the Core base types, i.e. Resource, Link or
Action. If a provider extends a subtype the new Category SHOULD be
related to the subtype extended, provided the previous rule holds
true.

Providers MAY also define new Category types for tagging and
templating purposes. Such a Category MUST NOT be the unique identifier
of a resource type, i.e. must not be part of the "static type system".

The scheme of provider-defined Category types MUST reside in a unique
namespace different from those in the OCCI specification. Any
attributes defined by a new Category MUST NOT have a name starting
with occi. The occi namespace prefix is reserved for extensions which
are standardized. A provider SHOULD use an attribute namespace
comprising the reverse domain name as prefix to every attribute name.

A provider-defined Category identifying a custom subtype of Resource
could be exemplified as follows. The term and scheme is defined by the
provider. The related set MUST include a, direct or indirect (through
a hierarchy), reference to the Resource base type category.

\begin{itemize}
\item term = custom\_resource.
\item scheme = \textit{http://example.com/occi/resource\#}
\item related = \textit{http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/core\#resource}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Extension of the base types}
A provider MAY define subtypes of the Core base types Resource, Link
and Action for domain-specific purposes. A unique Category MUST be
assigned to each new subtype. The assigned Category MUST be directly
related to the Category of the base type extended.

\subsubsection{Extension of subtypes}
A provider MAY define subtypes of any existing subtype, either defined
in OCCI or by someone else. A unique Category MUST be assigned to each
new subtype. The assigned Category MUST be either directly or
indirectly related to a base type Category. It is RECOMMENDED the
Category is related to the Category of the subtype extended.

\subsection{Discovery}
An OCCI client MUST be able to discover all Category types a
particular provider supports before interacting with the
provider. Since the rendering of the Category types is depended of the
protocol the rendering documents give more information on how
information is send and can be parsed.
